This is a very simple python script to fetch current watches and warnings for a particular area using the api.weather.gov api

I haven't written python in awhile so this was a fun way to get back into python while integrating my rekindled love of weather!
This also marks the first time I have used an API, and the first time I have managed to work with JSON!

Feels good to have an idea go to an actual program again, it's a nice feeling...

I'll probably continue extending it and making the program structure neater in the near future.

Only dependency is requests, everything else is standard python libs

BEEG UPDATE!!!!!
You can now select which area you would like to veiw alerts from! 
The quotes are neccesary for the NWS office.

USAGE: WxCLI [Your NWS forcast office] [Your state]

ex: WxCLI "NWS Fort Worth TX" TX
