This is a very simple python script to fetch current watches and warnings for a particular area using the api.weather.gov api

I haven't written python in awhile so this was a fun way to get back into python while integrating my rekindled love of weather!
This also marks the first time I ha used an API, and the first time I have mangaged to work with JSON!

Feels good to have an idea go to an actual program again, it's a nice feeling...

I'll probably continue extending it and making the program structure neater in the near future.
